### December 3 - Meet and Greet!
  
  #### Problem Statement
  - Sundar is an employee at Google. He comes to office at `9:00` and leaves office at `17:00`.
  - One day he got a sudden message from a employee to schedule a metting for 1 hour. He, Can choose any time between his working hours. But, Sundar is a busy employee already had several meetings on that day.
  - Develop an algorithm to finds an interval time which is greater than meeting time (i.e) 1 hour. So, Sundar can attend his meeting accordingly.
  
  #### Sample Input/Output
  ```
  Input: ["0930", "1100"],["1200","1330"],["1530","1630"]
  Output: ["1100","1200"],["1330","1530"]
  ```
  
  #### Explanation
  - He comes to office by `9:00` the first meeting starts at `9:30` so he can't assign a meeting.
  - The first meeting overs at `10:00` and the next meeting starts at `12:00`. Now, He has 1 hour gap. So, he can assign a meeting in between that.
  - Again he has interval of 2 hour between `13:30` to `15:30` so he can assign a meeting at that time.
  
  #### Note
  - All times are calculated in 24 hours format.
  - The working hour and meeting time is constant

### December 5 - The Grand Master

#### Problem Statement
- It was a dark and stormy night where an Oldman and his grandson were playing chess. The Oldman gave his grandson a problem, to check his knowledge and skills in chess.
- He stated that, It was a square chessboard of `A x B` size, the position of Knight `(C, D)` and position of a target `(E, F)` is given.
- Now the Grandson needs to find out the minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the target position. 
  
<p align="center"><img src="/src/assets/chess.png" /></p>
  
#### Sample Input/Output
```
Dimension of Board : 6 6
Position of Knight : 1 1
Target Position :  4 5 

Minimum Steps : 3
```

#### Explanation
- From the starting position of the Knight `(1,1)`. The Knight can move to either `(3,2)` or `(2,3)`. We choose `(3,2)`.
- From `(3,2)` the Knight can move to `(5,1)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,4)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,3)`, `(1,1)`. We choose `(5,3)`.
- From `(5,3)` the Knight moves to `(4,5)`.
- The Minimum steps required is `3`.

### December 6 - The Task Master

#### Problem Statement

  - Tim has lot of tasks to do but there are certain tasks which he must finish before doing others tasks and he wants to know the order in which he has to perform these tasks, for that he needs your help cause you are the task master.
  - Tim gives you a directed graph without any cycles, represented by a matrix where each index of the matrix represents a task. For example index `0` is task `A`, `1` is task `B`, `2` is task `C` and so on. 
  - Each task will have an array of tasks which can be performed only after performing the current task (the character represented by the index is the current task).
  - Implement a function `findCompletionOrderOfTasks(list*)` that finds the order of completion of the tasks.

<p align="center"><img src="/src/assets/dag-graph.png" /></p>

#### Sample Input/Output

```
findCompletionOrderOfTasks( [ ['B','C'], [], ['D'], [] ])
```
There are three possible solutions for the given input print any one of them.
```
A C D B
A C B D
A B C D
```

#### Explanation
  - The task `A` is not depended on any other tasks so it should be finished first.
  - Now there are two options either you can do task `B` or `C` as they depend only on task A which is already done.
  - If you finish task `B` after `A`, then you have to finish task `C` and then `D` because task `D` depends on `C`.
  - If you finish task `C` after `A`, then you have two options you can finish task `B` and then `D` or `D` and then `B`.

 ### December 7 - Temperature Screening
 
   #### Problem Statement
   - Due to strict quarantine, the Railways have included a queue to check the temperature of the passengers before boarding the train. 
   - It takes 2 minutes for a ticket to be generated in ticket counter `A`, while it takes only 1 minute for a ticket to be generated in ticket counter `B`. 
   - The queue for temperature check up is right next to ticket counter `B`, where the passengers from both the queues have to wait for their turn.  Develop a small algorithm that specifies the position of the passengers in the temperature check up queue.

   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
    Counter A: Aditi  Gautham  Ravi  Shreya
    Counter B: Karthik  Neha  Suman  Prakash
   ```
   ```
   Temperature Screening: Karthik  Neha  Aditi  Suman  Prakash  Gautham  Ravi  Shreya
   ```
   
   #### Explanation
   - Since counter B is closer to the temperature screening queue, only after 2 people from counter B move to that queue, one person from counter A joins them.

  2. `L`: `Ghgnv` -> `Fgfmu`
  3. `R`: `Fgfmu` -> `uFgfm`
  4. `H`: `uFgfm` -> `vGhgn`
  5. `R`: `vGhgn` -> `nvGhg`
  6. Therefore, the Derived Encrypted message for `Hihow` using the key `LLRHR` is `nvGhg`.
  7. Key size should be greater than one and contains only `L`, `H` and `R` where,
        - `L` stands for `-1`
        - `H` stands for `+1`
        - `R` stands for `Rotate`

### December 19 - War on Wakanda

#### Problem Statement
- Thanos has declared war in Wakanda. The brave soldiers of Wakanda have been defending their country against attacks for a long time. There is a shortage of food amongst the citizens. The governor of Wakanda has ordered the army to drop food crates via helicopters.
- Each helipad in Wakanda is located at the nodes of a Generic Tree. Due to constant attacks from Thanos, the dispatched helicopter cannot stay over civilian sky for long or it will be shot down by the enemy. The pilot has decided to cover the entire Helipad Tree with the least number of landings. Each Helipad node can cover the node connected to it by one edge.
- If the number of landings exceed a certain number, the helicopter will be shot down by Thanos.
- Since it is a high pressure situation, you have to help the pilot figure out the minimum number of times he needs to land his helicopter in order to cover the entire Helipad Tree without being shot and complete its mission (if possible).

#### Input Format
- We need to input two things- Tree nodes and maximum allowed landings.
- The first line of input contains data of the nodes of the tree in level order form. The order is: data for root node, number of children to root node, data of each of child nodes and so on and so forth for each node. The data of the nodes of the tree is separated by space.  
- Since data of each node is irrelevant, it will be taken as 1, representing that the node exists.
- Second line of each test case will contain an integer K representing the maximum allowed landings.

#### Output Format
- Print the minimum number of landings, and if the mission was Successful/Unsuccesful

#### Sample Input/Output
```
Input:
1 3 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0
3

Output:
2 Mission Successful
```
#### Explanation
For the given input the tree formed is given below, which can be covered with minimum 2 landings, which is less than the maximum allowed landings.

### December 20 - Show up people!

#### Problem Statement
- Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of all possible attendance records with length `n`, which will be regarded as acceptable The answer may be large, return it after `mod 10^9 + 7`.
- A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:
    - `A` : Absent.
    - `L` : Late.
    - `P` : Present.
- A record is regarded as acceptable if it doesn't contain more than one `A` (absent) or more than two continuous `L` (late).

#### Sample Input/Output

```bash
Input: n = 2
Output: 8
```

#### Explanation
- There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as acceptable:
- `PP` , `AP`, `PA`, `LP`, `PL`, `AL`, `LA`, `LL`
- Only `AA` won't be regarded as acceptable owing to more than one absent times.

### December 22 - Closest Servers
#### Problem Statement
- George's company is working on a contract with a leading Cloud Service provider. They have to choose `k` locations for setting up cloud servers from `n` cities.
- The locations should be chosen in such a way that the maximum distance of a city to a cloud server is minimum.

#### Sample I/O
```bash
  Input: distances = [
    [0, 4, 8,  5],
    [4, 0, 10, 7],
    [8, 10, 0, 9],
    [5, 7, 9,  0]
  ]
```
```bash
  Output: 0 2
```

#### Explanation
- `distances[i][j]` is the distance between city `i` and city `j`.
- The maximum distance of a city from a cloud server is minimized when the two servers are placed at cities `0` and `2` with the distance being `5` units.
- The distance of a city from a center is the distance between that city and its closest center.

### December 23 - The Rise of the Knight
#### Problem Statement
- The demons had captured the princess (`P`) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of `M x N` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (`K`) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
- The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. He dies immediately if his health point drops to `0`.
- Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (**negative integers**) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (`0`s) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (**positive integers**). To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
- Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.
- Note that the knight's life has no upper bound, and any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

     <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6C4rBVj.gif" height=250/></p>

#### Sample I/O
```bash
  Input:
	 -2(K)	-3	3
	 -5	-10	1
	 10	 30    -5(P)
```
```bash
  Output: 7
```

#### Explanation
- Input is the dungeon where `K` represents the Knight and `P` represents the Princess.
- Output `7` indicates that the initial health of the knight must be at least `7` if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.

### December 24 - Minify the damage
#### Problem Statement
- You are in a game where you have to fight some enemies. You are given an array of integers where each index represents an enemy and the value at each index represents the damage per second that the enemy can cause.
- You have k number of rounds and you have to fight with equal number of enemies in each round such that 
  - There are no two enemies with equal damage per second present in the same round.
  - The sum of the difference between the maximum and minimum damage per second caused in each round is minimum.
- Return the minimum sum, or return `-1` if it is not possible. Note that the array length is divisible by `k`.

#### Sample Input/Output

##### Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,1,4], k = 2
Output: 4
```

##### Explanation: 
- The optimal distribution of enemies is [1,2] and [1,4].
- The sum is (2-1) + (4-1) = 4.
- Note that [1,1] and [2,4] would result in a smaller sum, but in the first round there are 2 enemies with the same damage per second which is not allowed.

##### Example 2:
```
Input: [6,3,8,1,3,1,2,2], k = 4
Output: 6
```
#### Explanation: 
- The optimal distribution of enemies is [1,2], [2,3], [6,8], and [1,3].
- The sum  is (2-1) + (3-2) + (8-6) + (3-1) = 6.

##### Example 3:
```
Input: [5,3,3,6,3,3], k = 3
Output: -1
```
##### Explanation: 
- It is impossible to distribute the enemies for 3 rounds where no two enemies have equal damage per second in the same round.

### December 25 - Code Apocalypse
#### Problem Statement
- IIT Competitive coding competition is well know for setting hard problems for the contest. 
- During Code Apocalypse(Name of the programming competition) many teams were not able to solve single problem. 
- So we decided to do something different for the next contest. We will allow teams to work together but only we can decide which teams will work together. 
- If we say Team A can work with Team B and Team B can work with Team C then it means that Team A can also work with Team C and vice-versa.


- Now we repeatedly announce two type of announcements.
- First: W 1 3 which means Team 1 can work with Team 3.
- Second: ? 1 2 were you have to find if Team 1 and Team 2 can work together.

- For every Second type of announcement you will tell yes if the team can work together and no if the teams cannot work together.
- In the above second case the answer is NO

#### Input Type:
- First input intakes number of Queries.
- Second input intakes number of Teams.
- Then each queries is taken as input

#### Output Type::
- Number of yes and number of no

#### Sample Input/Output

##### Example 1:
```
Input:
6 
6
J 1 3
? 2 3
J 3 6
? 5 1
J 1 5
? 1 3

Output: 
1 
2
```

##### Explanation: 
- There are 6 team in Contest and 6 announcement made by IIT
- J 1 3 : team 1 and team 3 now working together
- ? 2 3 : the answer is NO
- J 3 6 : team 3 and team 6 now working together
- ? 5 1 :the answer is NO
- J 1 5 : team 1 and team 5 now working together
- ? 1 3 :the answer is YES

- So output is 1 2

FAQ
======

#### Who can join the Challenge?
Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?
You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?
Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it. Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day. Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?
Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it. Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it! Any and all languages are welcomed. Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this [small tutorial from our team](https://github.com/ASS-G/Git-Training-Kit) and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### Where are the rest of the problems?
Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

#### How should I complete these programs?
We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder. Be sure to rename your file to the following format: `language_username` or `language_username_problemname`
Some examples:
`python3_exampleUser.py`
`c_exampleUser.c`
**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. Enter these commands:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2020.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?
This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2020/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
