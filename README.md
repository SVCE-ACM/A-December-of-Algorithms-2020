### December 2 - The Convo!
  
  #### Problem Statement
  - Two friends were talking over the phone. They suddenly started to play a puzzle using the keypad.
  - The keypad contains digits from 2-9 inclusive. Develop a small algorithm to return all the possible letter combinations that the number could represent.  
    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O31uZDd.jpg" /></p>
  
  #### Note
  - Only 2 character combinations are allowed.
  - First you should display the character corresponding to the first number and then display the character corresponding to the second number.
  
  #### Sample Input/Output
  ```
  Input: 32
  Output: ["da","db","dc","ea","eb","ec","fa","fb","fc"]
  ```

### December 3 - Meet and Greet!
  
  #### Problem Statement
  - Sundar is an employee at Google. He comes to office at `9:00` and leaves office at `17:00`.
  - One day he got a sudden message from a employee to schedule a metting for 1 hour. He, Can choose any time between his working hours. But, Sundar is a busy employee already had several meetings on that day.
  - Develop an algorithm to finds an interval time which is greater than meeting time (i.e) 1 hour. So, Sundar can attend his meeting accordingly.
  
  #### Sample Input/Output
  ```
  Input: ["0930", "1100"],["1200","1330"],["1530","1630"]
  Output: ["1100","1200"],["1330","1530"]
  ```
  
  #### Explanation
  - He comes to office by `9:00` the first meeting starts at `9:30` so he can't assign a meeting.
  - The first meeting overs at `10:00` and the next meeting starts at `12:00`. Now, He has 1 hour gap. So, he can assign a meeting in between that.
  - Again he has interval of 2 hour between `13:30` to `15:30` so he can assign a meeting at that time.
  
  #### Note
  - All times are calculated in 24 hours format.
  - The working hour and meeting time is constant

### December 5 - The Grand Master

#### Problem Statement
- It was a dark and stormy night where an Oldman and his grandson were playing chess. The Oldman gave his grandson a problem, to check his knowledge and skills in chess.
- He stated that, It was a square chessboard of `A x B` size, the position of Knight `(C, D)` and position of a target `(E, F)` is given.
- Now the Grandson needs to find out the minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the target position. 
  
<p align="center"><img src="/src/assets/chess.png" /></p>
  
#### Sample Input/Output
```
Dimension of Board : 6 6
Position of Knight : 1 1
Target Position :  4 5 

Minimum Steps : 3
```

#### Explanation
- From the starting position of the Knight `(1,1)`. The Knight can move to either `(3,2)` or `(2,3)`. We choose `(3,2)`.
- From `(3,2)` the Knight can move to `(5,1)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,4)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,3)`, `(1,1)`. We choose `(5,3)`.
- From `(5,3)` the Knight moves to `(4,5)`.
- The Minimum steps required is `3`.

### December 6 - The Task Master

#### Problem Statement

  - Tim has lot of tasks to do but there are certain tasks which he must finish before doing others tasks and he wants to know the order in which he has to perform these tasks, for that he needs your help cause you are the task master.
  - Tim gives you a directed graph without any cycles, represented by a matrix where each index of the matrix represents a task. For example index `0` is task `A`, `1` is task `B`, `2` is task `C` and so on. 
  - Each task will have an array of tasks which can be performed only after performing the current task (the character represented by the index is the current task).
  - Implement a function `findCompletionOrderOfTasks(list*)` that finds the order of completion of the tasks.

<p align="center"><img src="/src/assets/dag-graph.png" /></p>

#### Sample Input/Output

```
findCompletionOrderOfTasks( [ ['B','C'], [], ['D'], [] ])
```
There are three possible solutions for the given input print any one of them.
```
A C D B
A C B D
A B C D
```

#### Explanation
  - The task `A` is not depended on any other tasks so it should be finished first.
  - Now there are two options either you can do task `B` or `C` as they depend only on task A which is already done.
  - If you finish task `B` after `A`, then you have to finish task `C` and then `D` because task `D` depends on `C`.
  - If you finish task `C` after `A`, then you have two options you can finish task `B` and then `D` or `D` and then `B`.

 ### December 7 - Temperature Screening
 
   #### Problem Statement
   - Due to strict quarantine, the Railways have included a queue to check the temperature of the passengers before boarding the train. 
   - It takes 2 minutes for a ticket to be generated in ticket counter `A`, while it takes only 1 minute for a ticket to be generated in ticket counter `B`. 
   - The queue for temperature check up is right next to ticket counter `B`, where the passengers from both the queues have to wait for their turn.  Develop a small algorithm that specifies the position of the passengers in the temperature check up queue.

   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
    Counter A: Aditi  Gautham  Ravi  Shreya
    Counter B: Karthik  Neha  Suman  Prakash
   ```
   ```
   Temperature Screening: Karthik  Neha  Aditi  Suman  Prakash  Gautham  Ravi  Shreya
   ```
   
   #### Explanation
   - Since counter B is closer to the temperature screening queue, only after 2 people from counter B move to that queue, one person from counter A joins them.

### December 16 - Max's Party
  
  #### Problem Statement
  - The neighbourhood of greenwood want to throw an appreciation party for their beloved mailman max. They want to get word around, but dont want to spoil the suprise for max. So they decide to encrypt their letter.
  - They decide to use ROT encryption technique, which is a simple character substitution based on a shift/rotation of `N` letters in an alphabet to circulate their messages. Help the neighbourhood encrypt a string `message` with a `Key` using ROT encryption technique as demonstrated below. 
  
  #### Sample Input And Output
  ```
  Message: "Hihow" 
  Key: LLRHR
  ```
  ```
  Encrypted Message: "nvGhg"
  ```
  #### Step-wise Explanation 
  1. `L`: `Hihow` -> `Ghgnv`
  2. `L`: `Ghgnv` -> `Fgfmu`
  3. `R`: `Fgfmu` -> `uFgfm`
  4. `H`: `uFgfm` -> `vGhgn`
  5. `R`: `vGhgn` -> `nvGhg`
  6. Therefore, the Derived Encrypted message for `Hihow` using the key `LLRHR` is `nvGhg`.
  7. Key size should be greater than one and contains only `L`, `H` and `R` where,
        - `L` stands for `-1`
        - `H` stands for `+1`

### December 18 - Is this a valid new user

#### Problem Statement

- During a hackathon your friend Shyam is trying to add a user authentication feature.
- He is asking you to implement an algorithm to validate and check the availability for a given username.
- The rules for username validation are
  1. It can contain characters `a-z` or `A-Z`.
  2. It can contain numbers `0-9`.
  3. Special characters like period (`.`) underscore(`_`) or dash (`-`) is allowed, other special characters are not allowed.
  4. It should not contain any whitespace characters.
  5. The length of the username should not exceed 20.
- Fetch the data from the [fake users API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to check whether the given username is available or not.

#### Sample Input/Output

##### Example 1

```
Input: Peter_Smith-24
Output: The username is valid and available.
```

##### Example 2

```
Input: Leopoldo_Corkery

FAQ
======

#### Who can join the Challenge?
Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?
You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?
Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it. Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day. Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?
Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it. Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it! Any and all languages are welcomed. Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this [small tutorial from our team](https://github.com/ASS-G/Git-Training-Kit) and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### Where are the rest of the problems?
Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

#### How should I complete these programs?
We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder. Be sure to rename your file to the following format: `language_username` or `language_username_problemname`
Some examples:
`python3_exampleUser.py`
`c_exampleUser.c`
**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. Enter these commands:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2020.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?
This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2020/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
